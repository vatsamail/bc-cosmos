### Notes: 
#### Module 1: What is Cosmos?
* Peer to Peer network for Digital currency by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 called bitcoin based on Proof-Of-Work.
* But bitcoin is monolithic and not turing complete.
* Ethereum was smart contract based methd that was turing complete, self-(executing, enforcing and verifying) in 2012ish. The app layer of etherum was EVM (virtual machine). 10 minutes on bitcoin was 15 seconds on ethereum. Although solved to make it programmable, it was less scalable, throughput etc.
*  Concept of finality: A finality is where a block cannot be removed or revoked after a transaction on the chain. Probabilistic finality will be lower of a block to be removed has more subsequent blocks. Absolute finality os PoS based where block cannot be removed after verified.
* Note: Ethereum has 2 types of goverencce. Chain goverence and then application goverence.
* R3's corda and hyperledger projects are private networks.
* PoW vs PoS: Based on the work. PoS can always have absolute finality as total stake amount is already known. 
* Cosmos is a n/w of interoperable chains.
* Tindermint: BFT algorithm
* Cosmos solving scalability: horizantal == increase nodes, vertical == increase compute of each node
* Cosmos promotes sovernity: 2 layer governce built on common chain goverence with independent dapp gooverence.

* Cosmos has tokens, wallets, sdks, apps, repos, sevices and tools
